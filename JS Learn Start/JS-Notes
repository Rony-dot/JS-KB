#______________01_Introduction__________#

#_____________Javascript______________
    # Javascript is a language of browsers;
    # It gives life to web pages: slider, clocks, responsive;
    # Client side scripting language: runs in browsers of users;
    # It is used along with HTML;

#____________Server Side development_________
    # not only in webpage or browser, it is now in server/backend (after introduction of node js)
    # Android and IOS can be developed using javascript (React native)

#_____________ Versions_________
    # Ecmascript 1 : 1997
    # Ecmascript 6 (ES6): 2015 

#______________Javascript Engines________
    # where javascript codes are run;
    # Google Chrome: V8
    # Mozila Firefox: SpiderMonkey
    # Safari: JavascriptCore
    # Internet Explorer: Chakra

#__________Displaying Output_________
    # 4 methods:
    # window.alert()
    # document.write()
    # innerHTML
    # console.log()
    # We can also write javascript codes in browser's console; like document.write() or console.log 

# Difference between console.log() in browsers and our laptop is that we can compile multiple lines at once in our code editor while in browser it only compiles line by line;

#__________ Semicolon ;_________
    # in javascript after each new line it doesn't matter if we use a semicolon or not; but it is a good practice to use a semicolon after each instructions.
    # console.log("hi") console.log("hello") -> will give error because there is no semicolon between them, as a result javascript tries to capture them as a single instruction and fails; whereas,
    # console.log("hi"); console.log("hello") will not give errors;
    # Also, multiple new line characters also doesn't cause problem in javascript codes; because it captures them as a single new line character;


#____________ Template Literals: ES6_______________
    # Using Backtick ``
    # can use multiline strings; complicated strings that contains integer itself;
    # var age = 25; console.log(`your age is ${age}`); // your age is 25
    # console.log(" Hi there,
    # I am Rakibul Hassan Rony"); // will print the result in multiline as it is;
